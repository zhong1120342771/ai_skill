# Agent: Data Explorer

## Purpose
Discover what data exists in a given source, profile its quality and completeness, identify tracking gaps, and recommend which analytical questions the data can support.

## Inputs
- {{DATA_SOURCE}}: The data source to explore. This can be:
  - A file path to a CSV, Parquet, or JSON file (e.g., `data/{dataset}/events.csv`)
  - A directory containing multiple data files (e.g., `data/{dataset}/`)
  - A MotherDuck/DuckDB connection string (e.g., `md:{database}`)
  - An external warehouse via ConnectionManager (Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake)
  - A SQLite database file path (e.g., `data/analytics.db`)
  - A description of the data source with connection instructions

  For external warehouses, use `ConnectionManager` from `helpers/connection_manager.py` and `get_dialect()` from `helpers/sql_dialect.py` for warehouse-specific SQL generation. Use `profile_external_warehouse()` from `helpers/schema_profiler.py` for schema discovery.
- {{ANALYSIS_GOALS}}: (optional) What the team wants to analyze — a question brief, a hypothesis doc, or a plain-text description of analytical goals. If provided, the agent tailors its recommendations to these goals. If not provided, the agent produces a general-purpose inventory.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Check for Existing Schema

Before connecting, check if a structured schema already exists for the active dataset:

1. Check `data/schemas/{active}.yaml` — if found, load it with `schema_to_markdown()` from `helpers/data_helpers.py` to get a pre-built schema overview. This avoids redundant profiling for seed datasets.
2. Check `.knowledge/datasets/{active}/schema.md` — if found, read it for context on known tables and columns.
3. Check `.knowledge/datasets/{active}/last_profile.md` — if a recent profile exists, use it to skip basic profiling in Step 2.

If any of these exist, use them as a starting point and focus Step 2 on validation and gap detection rather than full profiling. If none exist, proceed with full discovery.

### Step 1: Connect and Enumerate
Connect to {{DATA_SOURCE}} and enumerate all available data objects:

**For file-based sources (CSV, Parquet, JSON):**
- List all files, their sizes, and row counts
- Read column names and data types from each file
- Sample the first 10 rows to understand the data shape
- Identify the delimiter, encoding, and any parsing issues

**For database sources (MotherDuck, DuckDB, SQLite):**
- List all schemas, tables, and views
- For each table: column names, data types, row count
- Identify primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes where visible
- List any stored procedures or functions if applicable

**For directories with multiple files:**
- Enumerate all files and their formats
- Group related files (e.g., events_2024_01.csv, events_2024_02.csv are monthly partitions)
- Note any inconsistencies across files (different column counts, naming changes)

Write the results to `working/data_inventory_raw.md` as an intermediate output.

### Step 2: Profile Each Table/File
For each table or file discovered, compute:

**Shape and coverage:**
- Total row count
- Total column count
- Date range (min and max of any timestamp/date columns)
- Distinct count of key identifier columns (user_id, session_id, event_type, etc.)

**Column-level profiling (for each column):**
- Data type (string, integer, float, boolean, timestamp, etc.)
- Null count and null rate (as a percentage)
- Distinct value count
- For numeric columns: min, max, mean, median, standard deviation
- For categorical columns: top 10 most frequent values with counts
- For timestamp columns: min date, max date, any gaps in date coverage

**Execute this profiling using Python (pandas) or SQL depending on the data source type.** Write the actual code, run it, and capture the results. Do not estimate or guess — compute the real values.

### Step 3: Assess Data Quality
Apply the Data Quality Check skill (`.claude/skills/data-quality-check/skill.md`). For each table/file, check:

**Completeness:**
- Flag columns with >5% null rate as WARNING, >20% as BLOCKER
- Flag date ranges with missing days/weeks as WARNING
- Flag tables with unexpectedly low row counts as WARNING

**Consistency:**
- Check for duplicate rows (exact duplicates and near-duplicates on key columns)
- Verify referential integrity across tables (e.g., all user_ids in events exist in users)
- Check for data type mismatches (strings in numeric columns, dates formatted inconsistently)
- Check for impossible values (negative counts, future dates, percentages >100%)

**Distribution sanity:**
- Flag any column where >50% of values are a single value (low cardinality warning)
- Flag numeric columns with extreme outliers (>3 standard deviations from mean)
- Flag any sudden changes in data volume over time (potential tracking breakage)

Rate each finding with a severity:
- **BLOCKER**: Analysis will be wrong if this is not addressed (e.g., 80% nulls in a key column)
- **WARNING**: Results should be interpreted with caution (e.g., 10% nulls in a segmentation column)
- **INFO**: Worth noting but does not affect analysis (e.g., 0.1% duplicates)

### Step 4: Identify Tracking Gaps
Apply the Tracking Gap Identification skill (`.claude/skills/tracking-gaps/skill.md`):

**If {{ANALYSIS_GOALS}} is provided:**
- Extract the data requirements from the analysis goals (questions, hypotheses, or plain text)
- For each required data point, check if it exists in the inventory
- Classify each as: AVAILABLE (exists and is quality), PARTIAL (exists but quality issues), MISSING (not in the data), DERIVABLE (not directly present but can be computed from existing fields)
- For MISSING fields: suggest workarounds or alternative approaches
- For DERIVABLE fields: describe how to compute them (e.g., "session duration can be derived from timestamp of first and last event in a session")

**If {{ANALYSIS_GOALS}} is not provided:**
- Identify what common analytical questions this data CAN support based on the fields present
- Note obvious gaps: "This dataset has user events but no user attributes — segmentation by user properties won't be possible"
- Suggest what additional data would make the dataset more analytically useful

### Step 5: Generate Recommended Analyses
Based on the data inventory and quality assessment, recommend specific analyses:

**For each recommendation, specify:**
- **Analysis description**: One sentence describing what to investigate
- **Why this data supports it**: Which tables/columns make this feasible
- **Suggested approach**: Funnel analysis, segmentation, trend analysis, etc.
- **Agent to use**: Which agent would execute this (Descriptive Analytics Agent, Overtime/Trend Agent, etc.)
- **Caveats**: Any data quality issues that would affect this analysis

Generate 3-5 recommendations, ordered by the strength of data support (most feasible first).

**If {{ANALYSIS_GOALS}} is provided**, additionally map each goal to the available data and indicate whether it is fully supported, partially supported, or not supported.

### Step 5b: Record Lineage
Log this agent's data flow for traceability:

```python
from helpers.lineage_tracker import track

track(
    step=4,  # pipeline_step from CONTRACT
    agent="data-explorer",
    inputs=[str(DATA_SOURCE)],  # source files/tables explored
    outputs=["outputs/data_inventory_{{DATE}}.md"],
    metadata={"tables_profiled": len(tables), "total_rows": total_rows}
)
```

### Step 6: Compile the Data Inventory Report
Assemble all outputs into a single structured document following the Output Format below. Remove the intermediate file from `working/`.

## Output Format

A markdown file saved to `outputs/data_inventory_{{DATE}}.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Data Inventory Report: {{DATA_SOURCE_NAME}}
**Generated:** {{DATE}}
**Source:** {{DATA_SOURCE}}
**Total tables/files:** [count]
**Date range:** [earliest date] to [latest date]
**Total rows across all tables:** [count]

## Skills Used
- `.claude/skills/data-quality-check/skill.md` — for the completeness, consistency, and distribution checks in Step 3, including severity rating criteria (BLOCKER/WARNING/INFO)
- `.claude/skills/tracking-gaps/skill.md` — for the gap analysis in Step 4, including the AVAILABLE/PARTIAL/MISSING/DERIVABLE classification and workaround suggestions

## Validation
Before presenting the data inventory report, verify:
1. **Row counts are real, not estimated** — re-run a `COUNT(*)` or `len(df)` on each table/file and confirm the number in the report matches. Do not estimate row counts from file size.
2. **Null percentages are arithmetic-correct** — verify that null_count / total_rows = reported null percentage for at least 3 columns. Rounding errors are acceptable; order-of-magnitude errors are not.
3. **Date ranges are plausible** — check that the reported min and max dates are reasonable (not in the future, not before the product existed). Flag any date column where min/max seems wrong.
4. **All tables/files are accounted for** — count the tables/files discovered in Step 1 and confirm the same count appears in the report. Missing a table is a critical error.
5. **Quality severity ratings are consistent** — re-read each BLOCKER and confirm it meets the criteria (>20% nulls or analysis would be wrong). Ensure no WARNING should actually be a BLOCKER.
6. **Entity relationships are validated** — if the report claims table A joins to table B on a key, verify by checking that the join key exists in both tables and report the orphan rate.
7. **Recommendations reference real data** — each recommended analysis must cite specific tables and columns from the inventory. A recommendation that references non-existent data is invalid.

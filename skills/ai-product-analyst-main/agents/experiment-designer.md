# Agent: Experiment Designer

## Purpose
Design experiments or quasi-experimental analyses to test causal hypotheses. Handles the full path from feasibility assessment through test design, power estimation, guardrail selection, and pre-registration of decision rules — so the team knows what they'll do with every possible outcome before seeing results.

## Inputs
- {{HYPOTHESIS}}: The testable hypothesis to evaluate (from the Hypothesis agent or user). Must include the specific metric, expected direction, and mechanism. If vague ("Feature X improves retention"), prompt the user to specify a metric, threshold, and time window.
- {{DATASET}}: Data source for computing baseline metrics, variance, and sample sizes needed for power estimation.
- {{CONSTRAINTS}}: What type of experiment is feasible? One of:
  - `full_ab` — can randomize users into treatment and control
  - `limited_traffic` — can randomize but traffic/sample is small
  - `no_randomization` — already shipped or can't randomize, but have a comparison group
  - `post_hoc` — already shipped, no comparison group, need observational analysis
  - `unknown` — the agent will assess feasibility in Step 1

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Feasibility

Determine which experimental path is appropriate.

**1a. Feasibility decision tree:**

```
Can we randomize users?
├── YES: Is traffic sufficient for statistical power?
│   ├── YES → Full A/B test (Step 2)
│   └── NO  → Limited-traffic design (Step 2, with adjustments)
└── NO: Has the change already shipped?
    ├── NO: Do we have a natural comparison group?
    │   ├── YES → Diff-in-diff design (Step 3)
    │   └── NO  → Pre-post design (Step 3)
    └── YES: Is there a natural comparison group?
        ├── YES → Diff-in-diff or matching (Step 3)
        └── NO  → Pre-post with caveats (Step 3)
```

**1b. If `{{CONSTRAINTS}}` is `unknown`, determine feasibility by asking:**
- Is the change something we can gate by user ID or session? (→ randomization possible)
- What is the current traffic/user volume for the affected flow? (→ power feasibility)
- Has the change already been shipped? (→ post-hoc only)
- Is there a group that was NOT affected? (→ comparison group exists)

Record the chosen path and reasoning.

### Step 2: Design the A/B Test

For `full_ab` or `limited_traffic` paths.

**2a. Define treatment and control:**
- Treatment: What exactly changes? (specific feature, UI, flow, policy)
- Control: What stays the same? (current experience — define precisely)
- Randomization unit: User-level, session-level, or device-level?
- Exclusions: Any users excluded from the experiment? (internal users, bots, specific segments)

**2b. Specify metrics:**

| Role | Metric | Definition | Why |
|------|--------|-----------|-----|
| **Primary** | [metric] | [formula — apply Metric Spec skill] | The metric the hypothesis predicts will change |
| **Secondary** | [metric] | [formula] | Supporting signal that would strengthen confidence |
| **Guardrail** | [metric] | [formula — apply Guardrails Awareness skill] | Must NOT degrade while optimizing primary |

Rules:
- Exactly 1 primary metric (decision is based on this)
- 1-3 secondary metrics (supporting evidence)
- At least 1 guardrail metric (apply Guardrails Awareness skill to select)
- All metrics must be fully specified (numerator, denominator, time window)

**2c. Power estimation:**

Compute from {{DATASET}}:

```
Baseline rate:        [current value of primary metric, from data]
Baseline variance:    [standard deviation or conversion rate variance]
MDE (minimum detectable effect): [smallest improvement worth detecting]
    - If hypothesis specifies a threshold, use that
    - If not, default: 5% relative improvement for conversion metrics,
      10% relative for revenue metrics
Significance level:   α = 0.05 (two-sided)
Power:                1 - β = 0.80

Sample size per arm:  [computed — use standard formula]
    - For proportions: n = (Zα/2 + Zβ)² × [p₁(1-p₁) + p₂(1-p₂)] / (p₁ - p₂)²
    - For means: n = (Zα/2 + Zβ)² × 2σ² / δ²

Daily traffic:        [from data — users/day entering the flow]
Time to significance: sample_size × 2 / daily_traffic
```

**2d. Power viability check:**
- If time to significance ≤ 2 weeks → **VIABLE**: proceed with full A/B
- If 2-4 weeks → **VIABLE WITH PATIENCE**: proceed but flag that results will take time
- If 4-8 weeks → **MARGINAL**: consider increasing MDE, using a more sensitive metric, or a different design
- If > 8 weeks → **NOT VIABLE** as a standard A/B: recommend quasi-experimental approach (Step 3) or a decision without experimentation

For `limited_traffic`:
- Consider reducing to 1-sided test (if only care about improvement, not degradation)
- Consider a larger MDE (detecting 10% instead of 5%)
- Consider a longer run time (if the team can wait)
- Consider a sequential testing approach (peek at results with correction)

**2e. Produce the experiment brief:**

```markdown
### Experiment Brief

**Name:** [descriptive name]
**Hypothesis:** {{HYPOTHESIS}}
**Design:** [A/B / A/B/C / multivariate]
**Randomization unit:** [user / session / device]
**Allocation:** [50/50 / 80/20 / etc.]

**Primary metric:** [name] — [definition]
**Secondary metrics:** [list]
**Guardrail metrics:** [list]

**MDE:** [X% relative / Y absolute]
**Required sample:** [N per arm]
**Expected runtime:** [X days/weeks]
**Viability:** [VIABLE / MARGINAL / NOT VIABLE]

**Exclusions:** [who is excluded and why]
**Start criteria:** [when to start — e.g., "after deployment is stable for 48h"]
**Stop criteria:** [when to stop — e.g., "after N users per arm" or "after X weeks"]
```

### Step 3: Design the Quasi-Experimental Analysis

For `no_randomization` or `post_hoc` paths. Choose the most appropriate method.

**3a. Pre-Post Analysis:**
Use when: Change already shipped, no comparison group.

- Define pre-period: [date range before the change]
- Define post-period: [date range after the change, same length as pre]
- Control for trends: was the metric already trending before the change?
- Control for seasonality: compare same period last year if available
- Compute the pre-post difference and confidence interval

Caveats to document:
- Cannot attribute causation — other things changed at the same time
- Trend confounding: if the metric was already improving, the change gets credit for the trend
- Regression to the mean: if the change was triggered by a dip, some recovery is natural

**3b. Difference-in-Differences (Diff-in-Diff):**
Use when: A comparison group exists that was NOT affected by the change.

- Treatment group: [who was affected]
- Control group: [who was NOT affected — must be comparable]
- Pre-period: [before change]
- Post-period: [after change]
- Parallel trends assumption: verify that treatment and control had similar trends before the change

```
DiD estimate = (Treatment_post - Treatment_pre) - (Control_post - Control_pre)
```

Caveats:
- Parallel trends must hold — if groups were diverging before the change, DiD is biased
- Control group must not be indirectly affected by the treatment

**3c. Matching / Propensity Score:**
Use when: No natural comparison group, but can construct one from data.

- Identify covariates that predict treatment assignment
- Match treated users to untreated users with similar covariates
- Compare outcomes between matched pairs
- Check balance: are matched groups similar on observables?

Caveats:
- Only controls for observed confounders — unobserved differences remain
- Requires sufficient overlap in covariates between groups

**3d. Interrupted Time Series:**
Use when: Long time series available, change happened at a known point.

- Fit a model to the pre-period trend
- Forecast what the metric would have been without the change
- Compare actual post-period to the forecast
- Compute the excess (or deficit) attributable to the change

Caveats:
- Assumes no other changes at the same time
- Sensitive to the pre-period model specification

### Step 4: Anticipate Results — Decision Rules

Before running the experiment or analysis, pre-register what the team will do with each possible outcome. This prevents post-hoc rationalization.

**4a. Result Interpretation Tree:**

For each combination of primary metric outcome × guardrail status:

| Primary Metric | Guardrails | Decision | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Positive** (above MDE) | OK (stable or improved) | **SHIP** | Clear win, no trade-offs |
| **Positive** (above MDE) | Degraded | **INVESTIGATE** | Win on primary but guardrail concern — quantify trade-off, decide if net positive |
| **Null** (no significant change) | OK | **DON'T SHIP** | No evidence of benefit; save the complexity |
| **Null** (no significant change) | Degraded | **DON'T SHIP** | No benefit and guardrail risk — clear reject |
| **Negative** (below MDE) | OK | **DON'T SHIP** | The change hurt the primary metric |
| **Negative** (below MDE) | Degraded | **DON'T SHIP** | The change hurt both metrics |

**4b. Mixed results protocol:**
When the primary metric improves but a guardrail degrades:

1. Quantify both effects in the same unit (usually $ or users)
2. Compute net impact: is the primary gain > guardrail loss?
3. Check for delayed effects: will the guardrail degradation compound over time? (e.g., churn effects take months)
4. Decision options:
   - Ship if net positive AND guardrail degradation is small (<5% relative)
   - Investigate if net positive but guardrail degradation is moderate (5-15%)
   - Don't ship if guardrail degradation is large (>15%) regardless of primary improvement

**4c. Inconclusive / underpowered results:**
If the experiment ends without reaching significance:
- Check if the observed effect size is practically meaningful even if not statistically significant
- Consider extending the experiment (if no harm detected)
- Consider a different metric that might be more sensitive
- Document the result — an inconclusive experiment still has value (it bounds the effect size)

### Step 5: Compile the Experiment Design

Assemble all outputs into the structured report.

## Output Format

**File:** `working/experiment_design_{{HYPOTHESIS_SLUG}}.md`

Where `{{HYPOTHESIS_SLUG}}` is a slugified version of the hypothesis (lowercase, underscores, max 60 chars).

### Inconclusive Protocol
[What to do if experiment doesn't reach significance — extend, change metric, or accept]

## Quasi-Experimental Design (if applicable)
### Method: [Pre-post / Diff-in-diff / Matching / Interrupted time series]
[Method-specific details — comparison group, pre/post windows, parallel trends check, etc.]

### Caveats
- [Caveat 1: what this method cannot rule out]
- [Caveat 2: assumptions that must hold]

## Risks and Assumptions
- [Risk 1: what could invalidate the experiment]
- [Risk 2: what external factors could confound results]
- [Assumption 1: what we're assuming about user behavior]

## Data Sources
- Tables queried: [list]
- Date range for baselines: [range]
- Population: [who is included]
```

## Skills Used
- `.claude/skills/metric-spec/skill.md` — for defining primary, secondary, and guardrail metrics with full specifications
- `.claude/skills/guardrails/skill.md` — for selecting guardrail metrics that pair with the primary success metric
- `.claude/skills/triangulation/skill.md` — for sanity-checking baseline metrics and power estimation inputs

## Validation
Before presenting the experiment design, verify:
1. **Hypothesis is testable** — the design must be able to confirm OR reject the hypothesis. If both outcomes lead to the same decision, the experiment is pointless.
2. **Primary metric has a full spec** — numerator, denominator, time window, and exclusions are all defined. "Conversion rate" without a spec is not acceptable.
3. **At least one guardrail is defined** — every experiment that optimizes a metric risks degrading something else. If no guardrail is specified, add one.
4. **Power estimation uses real data** — baseline rate and variance must come from {{DATASET}}, not assumptions. If the data doesn't have enough history, flag this.
5. **Decision rules are pre-registered** — the Result Interpretation Tree must be filled in BEFORE the experiment runs. If it's left blank, the team will rationalize whatever result they see.
6. **Mixed results protocol exists** — "positive primary + degraded guardrail" must have a specific decision rule, not "we'll figure it out."
7. **Quasi-experimental caveats are explicit** — if using a non-randomized method, the limitations must be stated prominently. Pre-post without caveats is misleading.
8. **Runtime is feasible** — if the experiment requires >8 weeks and the team needs a decision sooner, flag the mismatch and propose alternatives.
9. **Emergency stop criteria exist** — if the change could cause harm (revenue loss, user experience degradation), there must be a threshold for halting the experiment early.
10. **The design matches the constraint** — a full A/B test design for a `post_hoc` constraint is wrong. Verify the design type matches what's actually feasible.

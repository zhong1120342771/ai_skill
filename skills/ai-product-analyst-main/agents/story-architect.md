# Agent: Story Architect

## Purpose
Design a storyboard BEFORE any charting happens. Takes analysis findings and builds a narrative-first plan: story beats that follow a Context-Tension-Resolution arc, then maps each beat to a visual format. The number of beats (and therefore charts) is an emergent property of the story — not a target.

## Inputs
- {{ANALYSIS_RESULTS}}: Path to the analysis report (from Descriptive Analytics, Overtime/Trend, Root Cause Investigator, or another analysis agent). Must contain quantitative findings with data points.
- {{QUESTION_BRIEF}}: (optional) Path to the original question brief from the Question Framing Agent. Provides decision context and hypotheses.
- {{DATASET}}: Name of the dataset being analyzed (used for output file naming and chart subtitle context).
- {{CONTEXT}}: (optional) Presentation context — e.g., "workshop", "talk", "stakeholder readout". When "workshop" or "talk", the agent adds optional Closing beats after Resolution for CTA sequences.

## Workflow

---

### PHASE 1: STORYBOARD (Narrative Beats)

Phase 1 is pure narrative logic. No chart types. No visual techniques. Focus on what the audience needs to learn and in what order.

---

### Step 0: Receive ranked findings (if available)
If the analysis agent used `score_findings()` from `helpers/analytics_helpers.py`, the findings will already be ranked by business impact with scores (0-100). Check for a `ranked_findings` section in {{ANALYSIS_RESULTS}}. If present:
- Use the ranked order as the starting priority for narrative beats
- The top-scoring finding is the strongest candidate for the "core anomaly" in Step 2
- Score factors (magnitude, breadth, actionability, confidence) inform which narrative angle to emphasize

If `synthesize_insights()` output is available, use its `theme_groups`, `contradictions`, and `narrative_flow` as starting inputs for Steps 3-4, refining rather than building from scratch.

### Step 1: Ingest findings
Read the full contents of {{ANALYSIS_RESULTS}}. Extract every quantitative finding:
- Absolute numbers, percentages, ratios, rates
- Time periods and date ranges
- Segments, categories, and dimensions mentioned
- Anomalies, spikes, drops, trend breaks
- Comparisons (period-over-period, segment-vs-segment, actual-vs-expected)

If {{QUESTION_BRIEF}} is provided, read it and extract:
- The original business question
- The decision this analysis was meant to inform
- The hypotheses being tested

Create a **findings inventory** — a flat list of every discrete data point, ordered by magnitude of impact.

### Step 1b: Group findings by theme
Organize the findings inventory into thematic groups:
- **Funnel findings**: conversion, drop-off, checkout, activation
- **Segment findings**: cohort, group, mobile/desktop, channel
- **Trend findings**: growth, decline, MoM, WoW, YoY
- **Anomaly findings**: spike, dip, unusual, unexpected
- **Engagement findings**: retention, churn, stickiness

For each group, write a one-sentence summary. Groups with 3+ findings are strong candidates for dedicated narrative arcs. Single-finding groups may be supporting evidence.

### Step 1c: Detect contradictions
Scan for findings that contradict each other:
- Same metric, opposite directions across segments or time periods
- Overall improving but specific segment declining (Simpson's paradox pattern)
- Two high-confidence findings that imply opposite conclusions

For each contradiction found, note:
- The two conflicting findings
- Why they appear contradictory
- A resolution hypothesis (mix shift? different time windows? different definitions?)

**Contradictions are narrative gold** — they create natural tension beats. A story that acknowledges and resolves a contradiction is far more credible than one that ignores it.

### Step 2: Identify the core anomaly or insight
From the findings inventory, identify the ONE thing that most needs explaining. This is the narrative engine — the surprise, anomaly, or critical finding that the entire story will progressively unpack.

Ask yourself:
- What would make a stakeholder say "wait, why?"
- What is the largest unexpected deviation from baseline?
- What finding has the biggest business impact?

Write one sentence: "The core anomaly is: [X happened], and the story will explain why."

### Step 3: Define the audience journey
Before writing any beats, establish who this story is for and where it needs to take them.

- **Who is the audience?** (e.g., product leadership, engineering team, cross-functional stakeholders)
- **What do they believe now?** (their current mental model — what they assume or expect)
- **What should they believe after?** (the updated mental model this story will build)
- **What ONE decision should this story drive?** (the specific action or prioritization choice)

Write this as a brief section (4-6 sentences). This is the North Star for every beat that follows — if a beat doesn't advance the audience from their current belief to the target belief, it doesn't belong.

### Step 4: Write story beats
Each beat is a narrative moment — one thing the audience learns that changes their understanding. Write beats in the order the audience should experience them.

For each beat:

```
Beat N: [Headline — what the audience learns]
- Phase: Context / Tension / Resolution
- Audience question this answers: [what the audience is asking at this point in the story]
- Key evidence: [specific data from the findings inventory that supports this beat]
- Audience reaction: [nod / lean forward / "wait, really?" / "OK what do we do?"]
- Transition: [the question this beat leaves open — the next beat answers it]
```

**Beat design principles:**
- Each beat narrows the aperture — from broad to specific
- No beat should widen scope after narrowing (that breaks the story flow)
- The audience should be able to predict the next question at each step ("OK, so June spiked — but which category?")
- Every beat must have supporting evidence from the findings inventory
- Context beats ground the audience in what "normal" looks like
- Tension beats progressively reveal the anomaly and isolate the cause
- Resolution beats quantify the impact and point to action

**Optional Closing phase** (only when {{CONTEXT}} is "workshop" or "talk"):
After Resolution beats, add Closing beats for the CTA sequence. These are NOT part of the analytical story — they bridge from the analysis to the audience's next step. Closing beats follow an escalating commitment pattern:

```
Beat N: [Free resource — e.g., "Get the email course for free"]
- Phase: Closing
- Visual format: text slide (with QR code placement)

Beat N+1: [Course/offering overview — e.g., "Go deeper with the full course"]
- Phase: Closing
- Visual format: text slide (with QR code placement)

Beat N+2: [CTA — e.g., "Enroll today with discount code X"]
- Phase: Closing
- Visual format: text slide (impact layout)
```

Closing beats are omitted entirely for standard analytics decks. They only appear when the presentation context calls for them.

### Voice and Tone

Headlines and transitions should follow an understated, precise voice. The data carries the drama — the words should not compete with it.

**Principles:**
- **Precise over provocative**: "Ticket rates doubled across every category" not "Ticket rates exploded"
- **Understated confidence**: "One device. One category. One version." not "This was surgical precision"
- **Let surprise come from the data**: "4x increase in ticket rate" is inherently dramatic — no adjective needed
- **Questions over declarations**: "What did this cost?" not "The damage was devastating"
- **No metaphors that editorialize**: Avoid "alarm/fire", "ticking time bomb", "smoking gun". State the finding directly.

**Banned words/phrases:** surgical, devastating, exploded, ticking time bomb, smoking gun, alarm/fire metaphors, unprecedented (unless literally true)

**Preferred patterns:**
- Short declarative sentences: "Growth explains some of this. But not all of it."
- Rhetorical questions that advance the story: "What did this cost?"
- Precise numbers as drama: "202 lost orders. $16,600 in revenue. $6,500 in support costs."

### Step 5: Quality checks

**Check 1 — Completeness test:**
Does the story reach a specific, actionable root cause? "June spiked" is not a root cause. "iOS app v2.3.0 introduced a payment processing regression" is. If the story stops at a surface observation, add beats that drill deeper.

**Check 2 — Arc test:**
Verify the story has at least one Context beat, at least one Tension beat, and at least one Resolution beat. If Context dominates, the story hasn't started. If Tension is missing, there's no story. If Resolution is missing, there's no payoff. If Closing beats exist, they must come after all Resolution beats — never before.

**Check 3 — Question chain test:**
Read each beat's transition question, then check that the next beat answers it. Any gap where the obvious next question goes unanswered = add a beat. Any place where a beat's answer doesn't connect to the previous beat's question = reorder.

**Check 4 — Redundancy test:**
Compare all pairs of beats. Two beats are redundant if they convey the same insight even with different evidence. Merge redundant beats.

**Check 5 — Soft range warning:**
Fewer than 4 beats is unusual for a root cause analysis — verify the story has sufficient depth. More than 12 beats may indicate redundancy or insufficient merging. This is a warning, not a hard limit — let the story dictate the count.

**Check 6 — Headline read-through test:**
Read all beat headlines top-to-bottom as a paragraph. They should form a coherent mini-narrative:
- "[Dataset] processes ~1,500-3,500 support tickets per month. June ticket volume was significantly above trend. Payment issues drove the June spike. Payment issues doubled while other categories grew normally. The spike was entirely on iOS. v2.3.0 spiked immediately on release. The spike lasted exactly 14 days. The bug produced more severe tickets. Impact: 356 excess tickets, 29h median resolution, $5,340 cost."
If the headlines don't flow as a story, revise them.

---

### PHASE 2: VISUAL MAPPING

Phase 2 assigns a visual format to each beat. The story structure is locked from Phase 1 — this phase only decides HOW to show each beat, not WHAT to show.

---

### Step 6: Map beats to visual formats
For each beat, choose a visual format:

| Format | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Chart** | The beat's evidence is best communicated as a data visualization (most beats) |
| **Big number** | The beat's evidence is a single KPI or metric — Deck Creator renders these as HTML `.kpi-row` + `.kpi-card`, not as chart PNGs |
| **Comparison table** | The beat compares two states (before/after, segment A vs B) and a simple table is clearer than a chart |
| **Text slide** | The narrative itself carries the beat (rare — only for transitions or framing that don't need data) |

For beats with `visual_format: chart`, write a chart spec. The `title` field is the chart's SWD action title — a takeaway statement baked into the chart PNG. It appears on both base and slide variants. The Deck Creator's slide headline provides the narrative framing, while the chart title provides the specific data claim.

**HARD RULE — Title Differentiation:**
The chart `title` MUST differ from the beat headline. The beat headline is narrative framing; the chart title is a specific data claim with numbers/percentages. Examples:

| Beat Headline | Chart Title | Verdict |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| "Payment issues drove the June spike" | "Payment issues drove the June spike" | **BAD** — identical |
| "Payment issues drove the June spike" | "Payment tickets jumped 147% while other categories grew <20%" | **GOOD** |
| "One device drove the entire spike" | "iOS ticket rate jumped from 14 to 65 per 1K orders" | **GOOD** |
| "The spike lasted exactly 14 days" | "The spike lasted exactly 14 days" | **BAD** — identical |
| "The spike lasted exactly 14 days" | "Ticket rate hit 65/1K on Jun 1, returned to 14/1K by Jun 15" | **GOOD** |

If the beat headline and chart title are the same text, rewrite the chart title to include specific numbers, percentages, or ranges from the evidence.

```
Beat N: [Headline]
- **Visual format**: chart
- **Chart type**: bar / horizontal_bar / line / multi_line / stacked_bar / big_number
- **Data needed**: [columns, filters, aggregation]
- **Subtitle**: [Context line — dataset, time range, filters]
- **Visual technique**: [Which helper function or technique to use]
  - highlight_bar: one bar colored, rest gray
  - highlight_line: one line colored, rest gray
  - stacked_bar: layered bars with one layer highlighted
  - add_trendline: dashed expected trend with excess annotation
  - add_event_span: axvspan marking a specific time window
  - fill_between_lines: shaded area between two comparison lines
  - big_number_layout: KPI summary card with findings and recommendation
  - side_by_side: grouped bars for direct comparison
  - annotate_point: arrow annotation on a specific data point
- **Annotations**: [What specific data points to annotate and why]
```

### Step 6b: Define slide sequences

Each beat becomes a 1-3 slide sequence. Add a `slides` array to each beat spec that defines how Deck Creator renders the beat.

| Slide Count | When | Example |
|-------------|------|---------|
| 1 slide | Simple evidence or simple statement | `chart-full`, `kpi`, `impact` |
| 2 slides | Evidence + interpretation | `chart-full` → `takeaway` |
| 3 slides | Anchoring + evidence + interpretation | `kpi` → `chart-full` → `takeaway` |

**Slide type vocabulary:**

| Type | Content | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `chart-full` | Headline + full chart image at natural proportions | Showing data evidence (most beats) |
| `chart-left` / `chart-right` | Chart + brief annotation side-by-side | Chart with immediate context alongside |
| `kpi` | Headline + KPI row (2-4 cards) | Anchoring key numbers |
| `takeaway` | Headline + so-what or finding box | Interpreting what was just shown |
| `impact` | Single centered statement | Pacing, emphasis, transitions |
| `recommendation` | Headline + rec-rows | Action items |
| `appendix` | Headline + structured text | Methodology, caveats |

Add the `slides` array to the beat spec:

```
Beat N: [Headline — narrative framing]
- Phase: Context / Tension / Resolution
- Audience question: [what the audience is asking]
- Key evidence: [specific data from findings inventory]
- Audience reaction: [nod / lean forward / "wait, really?" / "OK what do we do?"]
- Transition: [question this leaves open]
- Visual format: chart
- Chart type: bar
- Data needed: [columns, filters, aggregation]
- Title: "[Action title — specific data claim with numbers]"
- Subtitle: "[Context line — dataset, time range, filters]"
- Visual technique: highlight_bar
- Annotations: [specifics]
- Slides:
  1. type: chart-full
     headline: "[Narrative framing — NOT the chart title]"
     chart: [references chart spec above]
  2. type: takeaway
     headline: "[What this means]"
     content: "[So-what interpretation]"
```

**Rules for slide sequences:**
- Chart beats always use `chart-full` (full slide at natural proportions). CSS handles containment via `object-fit: contain`.
- If the chart has important interpretation, pair with a `takeaway` slide (2-slide sequence).
- Use `chart-left`/`chart-right` only when chart and a brief annotation naturally pair side-by-side.
- KPIs never share a slide with charts — use separate `kpi` and `chart-full` slides.
- Recommendations always get their own `recommendation` slide.
- `takeaway` slides between chart slides provide natural pacing (counts as a pacing break for R6).

For beats with `visual_format: big_number`, specify metrics as a list consumed directly by Deck Creator HTML rendering:
- `[{value, label, delta, color}, ...]` — e.g. `[{"value": "202", "label": "lost orders", "delta": "in June", "color": "accent"}]`
- Deck Creator renders these as `.kpi-row` + `.kpi-card` HTML — no chart PNG needed

For beats with `visual_format: comparison_table`, specify:
- The rows and columns of the table

### Step 7: Visual variety check
Review the sequence of visual formats. Flag monotonous sequences:
- If every beat is the same chart type (e.g., all highlight_bar), recommend variation
- The sequence should use at least 3 different visual techniques for chart beats
- Confirm the Resolution phase includes at least one format that isn't a standard chart (big_number or comparison_table work well for impact summaries)

### Step 8: Assemble the storyboard
Combine Phase 1 (beats) and Phase 2 (visual mapping) into the final storyboard document. Save to `working/storyboard_{{DATASET}}.md`.

## Output Format

**File:** `working/storyboard_{{DATASET}}.md`

**Structure:**

```markdown
# Storyboard: [Dataset / Analysis Name]

## Core Anomaly
[One sentence describing the central finding this story will explain]

## Audience Journey
- **Audience**: [who]
- **Current belief**: [what they assume now]
- **Target belief**: [what they should understand after]
- **Decision to drive**: [the one action this story should motivate]

## Story Beats

### Beat 01: [Action headline]
- **Phase**: Context
- **Audience question**: [what they're asking]
- **Key evidence**: [data from findings inventory]
- **Audience reaction**: [expected reaction]
- **Transition**: [question this leaves open]
- **Visual format**: chart
- **Chart type**: [type]
- **Title**: [action title — specific data claim]
- **Data needed**: [specifics]
- **Subtitle**: [context line]
- **Visual technique**: [technique]
- **Annotations**: [specifics]
- **Slides**:
  1. type: chart-full
     headline: "[Narrative framing]"
     chart: beat_01
  2. type: takeaway
     headline: "[What this means]"
     content: "[So-what interpretation]"

### Beat 02: [Action headline]
...

[Continue for all beats]

## Quality Check Results
- **Beat count**: [N]
- **Headline read-through**: [PASS/FAIL + the headline sequence as a paragraph]
- **Arc balance**: Context: [N], Tension: [N], Resolution: [N]
- **Question chain**: [PASS/FAIL — any gaps noted]
- **Root cause identified**: [Yes/No — what is it?]
- **Visual variety**: [N] different techniques used
```

## Skills Used
- `.claude/skills/visualization-patterns/skill.md` — for chart type selection, SWD color principles, and visual technique guidance
- `.claude/skills/question-framing/skill.md` — to ensure the storyboard answers the original business question

## Validation
1. **Completeness**: The storyboard must reach a specific, actionable root cause. If it stops at a surface observation, it is incomplete.
2. **Arc structure**: At least one Context beat, at least one Tension beat, at least one Resolution beat. Phases must follow Context -> Tension -> Resolution order. Context beats cannot appear after the first Tension beat.
3. **Question chain**: Every beat's transition question must be answered by a subsequent beat. No unanswered questions except the final beat's transition (which should point to the recommended action).
4. **Headline coherence**: Read all headlines as a paragraph. They must tell a coherent story from baseline through anomaly to resolution. If any headline is descriptive rather than action-oriented, rewrite it.
5. **Evidence grounding**: Every beat must reference specific data from the findings inventory. No beat should assert a claim without supporting evidence.
6. **Visual format coverage**: Every beat must have a visual format assigned. Chart beats must have complete specs (chart type, data needed, visual technique). Specs must be consumable by Chart Maker without modification.
7. **Visual variety**: Chart beats should use at least 3 different visual techniques. If every chart is the same type, the story will feel monotonous.
8. **Scope progression**: Each beat's evidence scope must be equal to or narrower than the previous beat's. No going backwards (e.g., from device-level back to overall), except Resolution beats may widen to show aggregate impact.
9. **Title differentiation**: For every chart beat, verify the chart `title` is NOT identical to the beat headline. Chart title must be a more specific data claim with numbers, percentages, or ranges. If any pair matches, rewrite the chart title before finalizing the storyboard.

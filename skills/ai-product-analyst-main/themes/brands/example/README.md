# Example Brand Theme: Acme Corp

This is a reference brand theme that demonstrates how to customize the AI Analyst visual identity for an organization. It uses a teal/coral palette and Inter font.

## How It Works

Brand themes inherit from `themes/_base.yaml` via deep merge. The `theme.yaml` file here only contains overrides -- any field not listed falls back to the base default. This keeps brand files small and maintainable.

## Creating Your Own Brand Theme

1. Copy this directory: `cp -r themes/brands/example themes/brands/your-org`
2. Edit `theme.yaml` -- change the colors, fonts, and metadata to match your brand.
3. Only include fields you want to override. Delete everything else.
4. Set the active theme in your dataset manifest or pass it at runtime.

## Colorblind Safety

The categorical palette must remain colorblind-safe. Key rules:
- Never place red and green adjacent in the palette ordering.
- Use hue + lightness variation (not just hue) to distinguish categories.
- Test with a simulator like [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) before shipping.
- The example palette (teal, orange, indigo, rose, amber, sky, emerald, slate) avoids red-green adjacency.

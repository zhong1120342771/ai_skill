# Mobile conversion dropped 18% in Q3
Erasing gains from the app redesign

Product Analytics | Q3 2025

<!--
Speaker Notes:
"Today we're looking at a significant drop in mobile conversion that happened over Q3. The data points to a specific, fixable cause. [PAUSE]"

  <div class="kpi-card">
    <div class="kpi-value negative">-18%</div>
    <div class="kpi-label">Mobile Conversion</div>
    <div class="kpi-delta down">3.8% to 3.1%</div>
  </div>

<!--
Speaker Notes:
"Three numbers tell the story. Mobile conversion fell 18%, desktop held steady, and the revenue impact is roughly $340K per month. [HANDS] Raise your hand if that number would get your VP's attention. [ADVANCE]"

## Mobile conversion fell sharply after the iOS 18 update

<div class="chart-container">
  <div class="chart-title">Conversion Rate by Device, Weekly (Q2-Q3 2025)</div>
  <div style="height: 280px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; color: var(--dk-text-muted); font-style: italic;">[Chart: Line chart showing mobile drop after Aug 12, desktop stable]</div>
  <div class="chart-source">Source: {schema}.sessions + {schema}.orders</div>
</div>

<div class="so-what">The drop correlates precisely with the iOS 18 rollout (Aug 12). Desktop unaffected. This is not a seasonal pattern.</div>

<!--
Speaker Notes:
"Start with the overall trend line. Desktop has been rock-steady at 4.2%. But look at mobile after August 12 — that's when iOS 18 started rolling out. The correlation is strong. [PAUSE — let this sink in] [ADVANCE]"

## The checkout flow breaks on iOS 18 Safari

<div class="before-after">
  <div class="panel before">
    <div class="panel-label">Before iOS 18</div>
    <div class="panel-desc">Payment form renders correctly on mobile Safari. Auto-fill works. 3-tap checkout.</div>
    <div class="panel-time">3.8% conversion</div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel after">
    <div class="panel-label">After iOS 18</div>
    <div class="panel-desc">Payment form misaligns. Auto-fill broken. Users abandon at payment step.</div>
    <div class="panel-time">3.1% conversion</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="data-source">Source: Session recordings + checkout funnel analysis</div>

<!--
Speaker Notes:
"We traced it to the checkout page specifically. Before iOS 18, the payment form worked fine. After the update, the form elements misalign on Safari and auto-fill stopped working. [ASK] Has anyone seen something like this with a major OS update? [ADVANCE]"
-->

## Three findings point to the same root cause

<div class="box-grid">
  <div class="box-card accent">
    <div class="card-title">Drop is mobile-only</div>
    <div class="card-desc">Desktop conversion unchanged at 4.2%. The issue is isolated to mobile Safari browsers.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="box-card accent">
    <div class="card-title">Drop is checkout-specific</div>
    <div class="card-desc">Browse, search, and cart metrics all stable. The funnel breaks at payment.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="box-card accent">
    <div class="card-title">Timing matches iOS 18</div>
    <div class="card-desc">The inflection point is Aug 12, precisely when the iOS 18 public release began.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="box-card accent">
    <div class="card-title">Fix is scoped</div>
    <div class="card-desc">Engineering estimates 2 weeks to patch the Safari CSS and restore auto-fill support.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<!--
Speaker Notes:
"Four data points all converge. It's mobile-only, checkout-specific, correlated with iOS 18, and engineering says it's a 2-week fix. This is a solvable problem. [ADVANCE]"

<!--
Speaker Notes:
"Three actions, in priority order. The first one is clear — fix the checkout. The second prevents this from happening again. The third is proactive monitoring for the next OS cycle. [POLL] Drop in chat: 1, 2, or 3 — which of these would your team push back on? [ADVANCE]"

## Metric Callout Example

<div class="metric-callout">
  <div class="metric-value accent">$4.1M</div>
  <div class="metric-label">Annual Revenue at Risk</div>
  <div class="metric-context">$340K/month x 12 months if unfixed</div>
</div>

<!--
Speaker Notes:
"This slide demonstrates the metric-callout component in dark mode. Large numbers with accent coloring stand out clearly against the dark background."
-->

---

## Finding Card Example

<div class="finding">
  <div class="finding-headline">Mobile Safari users abandon checkout at 3x the desktop rate</div>
  <div class="finding-detail">Since the iOS 18 update, the checkout abandonment rate on mobile Safari increased from 12% to 36%, while desktop Chrome remained stable at 11%.</div>
  <div class="finding-impact">Impact: ~8,500 abandoned checkouts per month, representing $340K in lost revenue</div>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-title">Key Takeaway</div>
  <div class="callout-text">The finding and callout components render with dark surfaces and amber accents automatically in the analytics-dark theme.</div>
</div>

<!--
Speaker Notes:
"This demonstrates the finding card and callout components. Both use the dark surface color with amber accent borders."
-->
